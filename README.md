# Blockchain Development Portfolio
This a Blockchain Portfolio that consists of various Blockchain and Smart Contract Projects that I have worked on in recent months. The projects in this repo are presented in the form of Python, Solidity and Javascript files that can be viewed in any browser or accessed using Postman.

For a more visually pleasant experience while browsing this portfolio, visit oleratomasiu.com/blockchain

_Note: All Ether and addresses used in the projects (accessed under data directory) are for demonstration purposes only. I use those wallets primarily for testing purposes. Do not send real ether or cryptocurrencies to any of the addresses in this repo._

## Instructions for Running POW (Proof of Work) Blockchain Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run files as usual by using a Postman server, Vscode etc.
